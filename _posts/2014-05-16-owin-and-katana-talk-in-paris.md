After coming back from my long day in Paris, I finally uploaded the slides and demos of my talk with [Simone](http://codeclimber.net.nz/) about [Owin](http://www.owin.org) and [Katana](http://katanaproject.codeplex.com/).

The code used during the speech is available on Github [here](https://github.com/imperugo/ncrafts.owin.katana).

You can find 5 demos:

 - **01.OwinIIS**: Demo of running Katana on IIS Host
 - **02.OwinHost**: Demo of running Katana on OwinHost.exe
 - **03.OwinSelfHost**: Demo of running Katana on self host and with custom error page
 - **04.OwinWebAPI**: Running WebAPI on top of Katana
 - **05.OwinMiddleware**: example of using 3 different middlewares in the Owin pipeline. The 3 middlewares are built using 3 different approaches.

As usual the slides are available on Slideshare [here](http://www.slideshare.net/imperugo/owin-and-katana), but you can read them also from this post.

Finally I've to say thanks to all the people who come to the conference, and a special thanks to [Rui](https://twitter.com/rhwy), [ncrafts](http://ncrafts.io) conference was amazing!

Hope to see you next year!
