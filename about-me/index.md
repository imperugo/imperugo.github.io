<img style="padding: 10px;" alt="Ugo Lattanzi" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012/04/io.jpg" align="left" /> I'm a programmer specialized in enterprise application development using Microsoft tools and languages, with focus in web applications, service oriented applications and, generally, in all the environments where scalability is a top priority.

Thanks to the experience earned in the latest years, I'm now focused on technologies like ASP.NET MVC, Windows Communications Foundations, Azure, Nhibernate and HTML5.

Thanks to this passion in web development using ASP.NET, <strong>Microsoft granted me the MVP Award</strong> in this technology.

My activity started in the multimedia world: in the beginning of my career, I started as a consultant for some of the biggest Italian companies (Athena Concept, ADPlan Comunicazione, Las mobili, Pin Up Stars, Nero Giardini, Medimatica, Bontempi Casa, ecc.). Since the last 8 years, instead, I'm totally focused on web development.

Actually I'm workng as Senior Software Architect in <a title="Gaia S.r.l." href="http://gaia.is.it" target="_blank">Gaia</a>.

From 2007 to 2010 I worked in <a title="Mtv Italy" href="http://mtv.it" target="_blank">MTV Italy</a> as Technical Manager and chief of the Microsoft area for the software and web development department.

Since 2006 to 2009 I played a big role in the community world: I was Content Manager and Technical Contributor for AspItalia.com (one of the largest Italian .NET communities). Plus, I attended as speaker at Community Days (July 2008) and at WPC  (2008, 2009 and 2010).

I'm the author of various articles for some technical newspaper, Microsoft MSDN, etc, moreover I'm author of some webcasts (ASP.NET MVC: Powerful Data Form and ASP.NET MVC: Security, HTML5, CSS3). I attended many community conferences as a speaker and, currently, I'm a regular contributor of the most important Italian communities (UgiAltNet, UgiDotNet, DotNetMarche, DotDotNet, ASPItalia, WinFXItalia, Silverlight Italia, LINQItalia, etc) and technical forums.

<em> Come to Milan and learn the technologies you'll be using in your next projects: Advanced JavaScript frameworks, HTML5, REST frameworks, cloud, lightweight http servers, real-time web, low-cerimony web frameworks, and much more...</em>
<em> both on .NET and other technologies"</em></blockquote>
