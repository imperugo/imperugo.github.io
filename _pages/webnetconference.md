The web is evolving, and so are the techniques, technologies and frameworks used in web development. Together with <strong><a href="http://codeclimber.net.nz/">Simone Chiaretta</a></strong> we are organizing the <strong><a href="http://webnetconf.eu/">Web.NET Conference Europe</a></strong>, this fall, in North Italy.

Logistics is not 100% certain yet: it will be in North Italy, probably in Milano, and will be this fall, probably toward the mid/end of October.

What is sure, instead, are the topics: Advanced JavaScript frameworks, REST frameworks, Cloud, lightweight http servers, real-time web, low-ceremony web frameworks, both in .NET and in other technologies.

We’ll probably launch a call for speakers around of May/beginning of June, but if you already have a idea, start thinking about. We are expecting a European audience, so all talks should be in English.

To get an email when things becomes more defined you can register on the launch page of the conference, <strong><a href="http://webnetconf.eu/">http://webnetconf.eu</a></strong>. You’ll get a personal sharing URL with which you can help us share the good news, and get in return pre-emption right on the seats available, and might even win a free event t-shirt.

We also have a twitter account, <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/webnetconf">@webnetconf</a></strong>, and a <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/WebnetConf">facebook page</a></strong>, and the hashtag for the conference is <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23webnet12">#webnet12</a></strong>
