stuff, meet other developers and share your knowledge.

During my professional life I’ve been able to attend to many national and international conferences,
sometimes as a participant, sometimes as a speaker.

Here you can find a list of all the events I attended to: if I joined the staff as a speaker, you’ll find also the
details about my session. You will find also the list of the upcoming events I will attend: you are free to join
them, meet me and have a chat together!

The web is evolving, and so are the techniques, technologies and frameworks used in web development.</blockquote>
